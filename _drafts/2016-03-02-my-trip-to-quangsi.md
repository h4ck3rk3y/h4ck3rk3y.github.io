Readers of my previous blog at [Tumblr](0x-gyani.tumblr.com) would know that I had purchased a *Xiaomi Yi* an action camera which was essentially a *Go Pro Hero 4* at a tenth of the price. The camera was primarily purchased for the Thousand Dollar Challenge.

**4th January 2016**: A day before we had written our names on the *Quang Si Trips*blackboard of our Hostel the *Spicy Laos Hostel*. We were to leave today at 11.30 for our trip to *Quang Si*. We were waiting for a cab to take us all the way to the falls and back. The Cab came, we were on our way. We stopped at a couple of places to pick a few guests. My friend Edwin wanted to some Kips to pay the cab driver so we stopped at the currency exchange. He had purchased the Kips and was in the cab when he realized that his phone a *Moto X* was missing. He ran back to the exchange and it wasn't there anymore. He couldn't find it. After looking for it in the exchange shop and asking the shop owners we suspected that they knew where the phone was but weren't willing to tell us. When we asked to look at the footage of the CCTV camera they made some excuse and called a cop. The cop simply said *If you don't know where your phone is, I can't find it for you*. This lead to a small fight between us and the cop. We left the place. Edwin went back to the Hostel. I started walking around and I found that Luang Prabang was famous for baguette sandwiches. I couldn't take a picture so I borrowed the one below from *wanderfull.us*.
