The *android* stretch of the boot-camp starts this Monday. To get us up to speed Amir, the VP of Mobile Engineering has shared with the campers a few slides and a base project.

A part of the homework was to get the base project up and running and learn about android in the process.

Today everyone who is starting up starts with an App first approach. The idea is that the mobile market exceeds the web market. *Google* is considering to remove the instant search as the number of mobile searches now exceeds web searches. It is easier to get a mobile phone than a laptop and it get's addictive. You don't carry your laptop with you 24x7 but you do carry your mobile.

Having notifications delivered to the user anytime of the day is another plus of going App first. If you are an e-commerce company, the user doesn't have to go to your web page to see what offers you are running, they can simply see it in their notification shade as soon as the offer becomes live.

Recently companies are pushing for an appless world. Companies are racing to see who kills their App first. Though mobile brings technology in your hands, with Internet of Things the goal is to bring technology all around you.
