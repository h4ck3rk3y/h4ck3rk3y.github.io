So today was the first day at EIG. In hindsight I shouldn't have joined today. I haven slept in the last 30 hours. Induction was a long process. Went on for two days.

I finally setup the environment on day 3. It is all Java. The bad news is I don't like the language, the good news is I'll learn to work on a strongly typed language finally. God I miss python :(.
