2018 is coming up, so I thought I should write another post. Why do we haven't to wait another year to get started with things? That's rather silly.

It's a new year so there have to be a few changes. One of the easiest things that I am going to do next year is buy a new chair. My present chair is the cheapest I could find at Argos, it's tough to keep sitting on it.

So last year I wrote a post called [Bring it On 2017](https://gyani.net/blog/bring-it-on-2017/). I talked about stuff that I wanted to achieve or do in the year 2017. I thought I should do a similar post for the year 2018 but start it by reflecting on the year that passed.

# No Soda

I kept true to this till mid April of 2017. I had completely cut down on cold sugary beverages but then I started again. Since I've been in London(about September) whenever I get Soda, it's Coke Zero or something else made of artificial sugar. I'll follow try to follow through with the no sugary drink policy.

# Regular Video Logs

While I was in Singapore I would frequently record stuff but I never got to actually making videos out of them. [Shubhankar](shubh24.github.io) on the other hand is doing a pretty great job making regular vlogs since he got his GoPro. I have featured in two of his blogs this year. It goes without saying that this is something I'll not be doing. I'll be traveling and recording things but those videos will go to my personal collection.

# Run Daily

This was an utter failure as well. Started off okay but then I injured my leg skateboarding and then decided to be lazy. Recently I have started running pretty often again, my shin starts hurting soon but I'll sort it out. Getting fit is defintely on the top of list for 2018, as is the name of my gym *Fitness First*.

# Make Something Beautiful

I didn't make a new product this year. Did take part in a few hackathons. Made a new version of RouteRush that looked better but that doesn't count. I wrote a few papers, maybe the text and the research was beautiful. My GitHub hasn't been really active, I'll work on this. I aim on actively contributing to a FOSS project or working on something of my own throughout the year.

# Research Paper from My Time at SUTD

This worked out well actually. Have another paper in the loop.

# Stand up Comedy at an Open Mic Event

I have been writing material every now and then but have never actually performed. I think like the videos the jokes are for my consumption only. I might however perform once next year.

# Master Web Security

No progress has been made in this regard either. I am not working on web applications at work(luckily?).

# Full Stack Dev

No progress has been made in this regard either. I am not working on web applications at work(luckily?).

# Half Marathon

Another goal that went unfulfilled. I'll work on it over the next year.

# Cooking

I am decently good at cooking now.

# Functional Programming

I am beginning to think that the above list was too long and unrealistic. I didn't follow through with this either. Learned a little C++ though.

# Bali

This didn't happen either, will happen if folks from Pilani decide it's going to happen.


Anyhow to summarize, I plan on doing the following next year

- A trip to Colombia
- A trip to Bali
- Camping in Norway
- Read More
    + Physics
    + Non-Physics books
- Learn how to Invest
- Learn how to drive
- Build a network
- Always have an active side project
