So I was taking part in [sCTF 2016](https://sctf.io), a few hours go by and suddenly I am not able to access the competition's [page](https://compete.sctf.io) anymore. The **IPC** had added a programming competition's website to it's list of blocked websites. For those of you who aren't from BITS Pilani, **IPC** stands for *Information Processing Center* and is responsible for managing on campus Internet.
