This post like any other post by me has no structure. As this is a post after 2 months, it has a lot of clutter. You can skip sections and read whatever interests you.

# Hackathons, Meetups and Conferences

I just came from a talk I gave at the Singapore Python Users Group or PUGS as they call it. I talked about Lua for Python Developers and towards the end I introduced some Nmap and Nmap Scripting Engine. Hopefully by the end of this video engineers.sg will have uploaded a video of the talk. You can find the talk [here](https://goo.gl/O4yd0W). I don't work with Carousell, they just asked me to put the slide there.

It was a nice exposure, the group has around 2000 members, the talk was full as all 90 seats were taken on Meetup.com. In a 90 person meetup, 90 people never show up. The talk happened at the Carousell office. Carousell is a popular startup here, it's similar to OLX.

One reason to go to Meetups is free Pizza. Almost every decent Meetup has lot's of them. The second and more important reason is that you learn a lot. The third and the most important reason is that you get to meet with people who are doing things like you.

I've attended quite a few Meetups here. Started with Startup Teaming by Agile Singapore followed by a talk on Deep Learning by Martin Andrews hosted by PyData. After that I attended a couple of Block Chain talks one by Vitalik Buterin himself. The techincal meetups are definitely the best.

I've attended quite a few hackathons in the last month and 21 days as well. Started with a Hackathon at NUS called Hack N Roll 2017. It's probably one of the best Hackathons I've ever been a part of. They had people who gave away hardware for the hackathon. People built a lot of cool things. You can try a random but fun hack [here](https://mtga.azurewebsites.net/).

After this one I attended the NUS EdTech Challenge. Malavika does a great job spotting events. This is where I met Victor. A week after that Victor invited me for the MIT HackMed Hackathon where we built a cool robot. Rather we built on top of a cool robot.

Apart from this I attended a conference organized by my lab at the Grand Copthorne called the High Assurance Systems Engineering or HASE Conference. It was an IEEE conference and I met with researchers accross the world.

Bottom line, Singapore is amazing for technology. The community is young, experienced and full of energy. There are events almost everywhere. Some say Singapore is just brilliant for starting up, seed is easy and the climate
is just perfect.

# People

I have met very interseting people. I should start by mentioning Sridhar and Mujeeb. They have been amazing hosts and friends. They have really helped me settle in Singapore. Whenever I have any queries, they are always approchable.
On top of that Mujeeb is an excellent cook, him and Mohit cook excellent food, even vegeterian food. Mujeeb, Sridhar and Mohit are doing their PhD here at SUTD.

My supervisor here, Prof. Aditya Mathur is a great supervisor. He has been very helpful while guiding me for work and is super approchable. He responds to emails before you type them, despite having a busy schedule.

Through hackathons and meetups I have met this guy called Victor. Victor is crazy about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and in general new technology. We have been collaborating on projects since and hope to continue our collaboration.

There are a lot of people at the lab whom I should mention, Francesco, Lauren, Riley, Kaung and Zhaffi.

# Singapore

Singapore is a brilliant city. It's a city full of life. It's super safe. You can be roaming around at 4 am and not feel a thing. It feels as safe if not safer than Pilani but at a larger scale. As Victor says "Nothing gets stolen in Singapore(except for ideas he adds)."

In Singapore no one eats at home. Most people are eating at food courts. Most food courts close pretty early, maybe Singaporeans eat and sleep early. Pubs and Bars though at some places are open all night.

Singapore has an amazing night life. There are pub quizzes, music nights and standups almost every night.

There is something to do for everyone here. Malaysia and Indonesia are neighboring Singapore, so you can head there if you get bored. People say it takes about an year and a half to two years to get bored of Singapore. It's just been a month for me.

I'vent really been around Singapore. I've visited most of the main attractions though, almost all of them seem to be on the Green Line or on the East West Line. I always wonder what's on the other lines.

I'm yet to visit the Botanical Gardens or the Museums. I had visited Universal Sutdios and the Gardens in an earlier trip.

There is this part of Singapore called Little India. It's famous for the Mustafa shopping center. At weekends it really feels like India, primarly because of the conjestion.

There is a China town as well. It's splendind. China town is the place to be during Chinese New Years.

I'm visiting a town called Melaka next week. It's in Malaysia and it's a UNESCO world heritage site.

# Work

I started working at iTrust on the 2nd of January. That means that I can't say, "I just came here" anymore.

I started working on the Electric Power and Intelligent Control System(EPIC) but slowly shifted to Water Distribution Network(WADI). EPIC isn't ready yet so after discussion with my supervisor it was decided I start working on WADI.

I've been working on attacking WADI for a while now. I started by understanding WADI and it's communication channels. After that I explored every channel and the protocols involved. This week I achieved some success in attacking it and I am now working on the tool that would allow anyone to attack a National Instruments system.

iTrust tries to organize some social events every now and then. In January there was a football match and the New Years Dinner. There is always some free food being given away during or after talks by iTrust every week.

After I am done attacking WADI, I plan on moving to fingerprinting WADI and SWAT. More on that later.

## 2017 Promisses

The last post was about goals for 2017. I am proud to say that I haven't touched Soda(any sugary drink) in the last month and 22 days.

The other goals aren't moving so well.

Regular V is tough, I do record things but hardly find the time or energy to make a video out of it.

Daily Run was going on till I injured my knee skating. After that the run frequency greatly reduced. I'll start this again.

Last Friday I went to a gym with Victor. We worked out for 3 hours, Victor is crazy about gymming. My body has been paining for 3 days now.

Mastering Web Security, honestly I haven't been able to work on this goal. I have done some reading but not much. I really want this to happen. I'll work towards this.

Bali will definitely happen.

I have found a place to do the Open Mic, the Molly Malones Irish Pub. I hope to perform there on a monday night by March.

Not much progress on making something beautiful but I have found a collaborator it's just that we haven't started wroking on the products.

I don't think I'll be doing functional programming.

I'm going to definitely write a paper if not a couple of them from my work here. I don't see myself learning harmonica, there is no time.

Anyhow, I had made a lot of resolutions or promisses but now I have chosen some that I wish to keep and I divde them into three different categories.

## Has to Happen

- No Soda
- Fitness
- Get Published
- A Product
- Better at Security

## Seems to Happen

- Bali
- Open Mic

## Would be Cool

- Harmonica
