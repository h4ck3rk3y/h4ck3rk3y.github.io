Still here. Two months in a row. The writing muscle is slowly coming back.

## January Reflection

**Running** - Hit 100km. Goal met. The consistency was there, and it felt good to be moving again. Not fast, not pretty, but the kilometers added up.

**Reading** - Finished two books. Goal met.

**Weight** - Started at 73.70kg, ended at 72.90kg. The goal was to be under 72kg, a 2kg cut from the original 74kg. Didn't happen. 0.8kg down is something, but the goal was 2kg. Calling this what it is: a fail.

The stakes said if I run 100km or lose 2kg, I get an Invincible Run. If I fail both, £50 to charity. I hit the running goal, so the Invincible Run is earned. But the weight miss still stings, so both are happening. The shoe and the charity. £50 donated to [ShareTheMeal](https://sharethemeal.org/). No excuses, no technicalities.

| Goal | Target | Result | Verdict |
|------|--------|--------|---------|
| Running | 100km | 100km+ | Pass |
| Weight | Under 72kg | 72.90kg | Fail |
| Reading | 2 books | 2 books | Pass |

Two out of three. The monkey lost on running and reading. But it's still winning on weight. That has to change.

## February Goals

**Running** - At least 100km again. Keep the momentum going.

**Weight** - Lose 2kg. Get to 70.90kg or below by end of February. No more almost-there.

**Reading** - Finish one book.

## Stakes

If I hit all three, 100km, 2kg loss, and one book, I'm getting a soundbar.

For each goal I miss, £50 goes to charity.

Short and honest. See you in March.
