This has been a long weekend. 4 days of holidays. The weekend ends tomorrow but it already feels really stretched and wasted.

Last Friday we had a talk by the CTO of Go-Jek in the evening. One thing that stuck after the talk

>You only have 1500 weekends in your life

Now how should we be using these weekends? This is 30 years of weekends. Our actions should match our ambitions. One could waste all 1500 weekends that they get or actually work towards that goal they have always had.

If you really like music you could jam the entire weekend. If you are an adrenaline junkie and like to drive bikes at really high speeds then you could pursue that every weekend. If you want to contribute to Open Source then you should spend that time contributing.

Well what I am trying to say is do something productive, learn and work towards that goal that you have always had.
