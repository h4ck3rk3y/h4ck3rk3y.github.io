## What have I managed to do in the last week?

- Got a few pull more requests accepted
- Understand a little finance now
- Beginning to understand work better
- Done with one of my milestones at work
- Got accepted for a Gamedev Hackathon


I haven't done much about the emulator. I just read a little more about the CPU and how close it is too 8080. I'll create a Kanban board on the projects Github page and start working on it.

This is a really short post. I'll start posting more insightful things from the next week.
