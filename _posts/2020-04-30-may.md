## Looking back on April

[post](https://gyani.net/blog/april/)


1. **Running** Running, I wanted to run a minimum of 87.42 km. Earlier in the month I was rather bullish and was expecting to run more but with the lock downs and the park closures, running took a hit. I ran just over the monthly minimum at 87.57 km. Prize here was jumping ropes. ✅

2. **Weight** I started at 69.25 and I wanted to be 66.50. This afternoon, I weighed 68.50. That was after lunch though, I'd likely weigh less before lunch as a day before I was 67.9. Any who, this is failure. This didn't work out, so I need to donate 50 quid to charity. ❌ 

3. **Reading** I wanted to finish deaths end and 5 chapters of intelligent investor. This got done! I added a lamp as a mid month prize, I bought it before finishing the book. ✅

4. **Side project** I wanted to build a CI. [Here](https://github.com/h4ck3rk3y/triangle-ci) it is. Mid month I had added a motivator. The win was a copy of Hitman 2. I don't need it, but if I do I'll get it. ✅

## May

Corona poses uncertainitiy. It really tests discipline. Sitting at home isn't great for weight loss. That in mind, here are Mays goals

1. **Running** I want to run the daily minimum that's 2.914 a day so a total of 90.33400 km. I think this is ambitious enough given the lock down and the heat outside. Win: Self Respect. Loss: 50 GBP Charity to a food/health charity

2. **Weight** I'm at 68.5, but my without food weight is probably around 68.00. I want to get down to 66. That is ambitious, given Corona. I worry that if I don't set ambitious goals, I'll probably go over my current weight. How do I achieve this? I'll bring serious IF + 1500 again, I have been snacking outside of feeding hours. That needs to stop, new IF hours are 1pm to 9pm daily. I'll start sleeping on time, a fixed time. I plan on sleeping at 1 am and waking up at 9 am, every day for the rest of the month. Weekends included. Any time that I snack outside of 1 pm and 9 pm, I'll donate a meal on the Share The Plate App. Loss: 50 GBP to a food/health charity. Win: A Go Pro Hero 7

3. **Reading** I started reading Liar Poker by Michael Lewis. I want to finish that. I also want to read 5 more chapters of Intelligent Investor. In addition I had started watching a lecture of Aswath Damodaran every weekend, I'll continue that. I want to get done with the tutorial series on Tailwind CSS and the basic tutorial on [React.com](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Loss: Donate 50 GBP to Khan Academy/ Wikipedia or equivalent. Win: A laptop sleeve.

4. **Side Project** Not sure what to put here. For now lets say, release something in the wild with a frontend and a backend. It's tough to measure products in a month and have a goal for it. I'll probably come back to this tomorrow. I'm not sure what metrics to have. Number of users? Revenue? How do I do all of this in a month? So for now its vague, release a product for the world. I think having an MRR / active user count goal in the longer term is reasonable, so the goal here is to come up with a project scoped to a few months with a clear MRR/active user count goal. If I finish both these things, Win: A Herschel Backpack. Loss: 50 GBP Charity to Khan Academy / Wikipedia / Coding Group

5. **May Sky Challenge** Found this on Hackernews. Seemed interesting. Basically have to look at the Sky before looking at the phone on waking up. I'm in. No wins or losses here but I will share my success rate.

6. **NTC** I want to do 3 NTC workouts every week. That's about 13 for this month. Success: More workout equipment. Loss: Weight/Food Charity, the usual.


## General

I have been thinking of the post COVID world. I'll be doing the following

1. Lifting weights

2. Learning how to swim with a trainer
