I had been thinking of moving from my [tumblr](https://0x-gyani.tumblr.com) to somewere else for a while now. I had absolutely no time during the $1000 Challenge. After coming back to college, I wasted a week and from the 22nd of January productivity was at its peak. That is when RevMine, RouteRush, LaMusique, Recobot, Monica and Wolfe came to life. I published to pypi packages and one chrome extension. Won two hackathons, qualifiers of Microsoft Build the Shield, an HP event and APOGEE's very own Project Presentation Event.

This was followed by four bad days in which me and [@psdh](https://github.com/psdh) made a lexer, parser and a first and follow set for a toy language. After this we had a our batchsnap and the night of the batchsnap I sat for an hour looking for possible themes, I found beautiful-jekyll and loved the authors [site](http://deanattali.com) and decided to use it.

That is how this blog was born. This is a pre dated post. The post [*Once upon a time in Vietnam*](http://gyani.net/blog/once-upon-a-time-vietnam/) was written 17 hours before this one.
