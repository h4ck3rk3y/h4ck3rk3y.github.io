For the past few months I and [Shubhankar](https://github.com/shubh24) have been reading, thinking and discussing bots and conversational interfaces. We have been wanting to build a bot of our own. This is our first attempt at making a conversational Bot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Registration](/img/blog/dinnerbot0.png)

The *idea* is that no one wants to eat alone. After registering on our Bot, it asks you a few simple questions regarding **where you are** and **what cuisine** you prefer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Querying your Location](/img/blog/dinnerbot1.png)

Based on the input it finds you a dinner date in a **ten mile** radius, the restaurant is a random top rated restaurant on **Zomato**. The restaurant is located somewhere between you and your *dinner date*.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Match!](/img/blog/dinnerbot2.png)

The Bot sets up a link so that you guys can talk to each other and discuss things like when you would be reaching the location. You can share contact details with them if you like. From now on all messages sent to the Bot will be relayed to your *dinner date*. You can always break the relay link by sending the */exit* command.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Reveal](/img/blog/dinnerbot3.png)

The bot tells you that on reaching the location you should send your coordinates. On sending your coordinates you are revealed your *dinner dates* picture while your *dinner date* is sent an alert that you have reached the restaurant.
