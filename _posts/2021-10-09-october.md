Ok, September is here. 4 more months left. I know I am writing this on the 5th of the month. The last few days have been busy!

## Retrospective

1. **Running**: I wanted to be at 1496 at the end of the month. I am at 1500. ✅

2. **Reading**: I wanted to read the "Subtle art of not giving a f\*ck" by Mark Manson. I finished the book. ✅

3. **Weight:**: I wanted to weigh 63. I weighed 66.10. Clearly not a win. ❌

## September

1. **Running**: I thought I'd be doing lots of Kilometers this month but it doesn't seem to be going so well. I am done with 8 days in this month
and I am at 34.6km. I need to do at least 131.15km more for a yearly total of 1665.75 to be on track. I have a Marathon coming up on the 26th of November, I am not sure
how I am going to do that. I need to bring some motivation and lots of discipline back in.

2. **Reading**: I want to finish Bullshit Jobs by David Graeber.

3. **Weight**: This is the 9th of October and I weighed 66.65 this morning. I had not been weighing cause I didn't want to see the machine. Setting 65 as this months goal.
It sad that in the last few months I have been just increasing the monthly goal instead of lowering the weight. To make this more interesting the loss function for this bet is £150 instead of £50.
