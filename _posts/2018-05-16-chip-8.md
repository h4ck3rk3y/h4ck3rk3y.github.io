I've spent the last couple of weeks writing a CHIP-8 emulator in my free time. I have been talking about writing an emulator in my blog
for a while now. I wanted to write a Z80 emulator after playing Metal Gear Solid Ground Zero but I settled for writing a CHIP-8 emulator.

# What is an Emulator?

> In computing, an emulator is hardware or software that enables one computer system (called the host) to behave like another computer system (called the guest).

The above quote has been copied from Wikipedia

# Why an Emulator?

I've been fascinated with an emulator ever since I was a kid. I think my first emulator was CVGX, I spent countless hours playing
TEKKEN 3 on it only to realize that it was emulating a PlayStaiton 1. Then I spent countless hours playing Smackdown Here Comes the pain
after figuring out that it could play any PlayStation 1 game.

I eventually found VGBA an emulator of Gameboy and Gameboy. I started playing Pokemon Red on it. That was fun and I think I
followed that with Pokemon Blue. I think I caught all the legendary Pokemons including Mewto. That's a different story
for a different time.

I eventually bought a Playstation 1, my computer was too slow to emulate it then. I think I had a computer running Intel Pentium 4
at 1.6 Ghz and I got terrible frame rates with the PCSX2 emulator. In University I tried PCSX2 again as my PS2 wasn't working
and I really wanted to play Downhill Domination.

# What is CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language that run on the CHIP-8 virtual machine. It's a fairly simple system that can
run games like PONG and Space Invaders.

# Why CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 looked like the Hello World! in the world of emulation. It is a fairly simple system with monochrome graphics and
only one sound. It has 16 8 bit registers, 16 bit program counter, 8 bit delay timer, 8 bit sound timer and 4k of memory.
If you want to write an emulator for CHIP-8 I'd highly recommend the following [manual](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#1nnn)
and the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

If you want further help then you can have a peep at this [article](http://multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/).

# How do I do it?

This is how the chip-8 roughly works.

```go

func emulateCycle() {
  // fetch opcode
  // decode opcode
  // execute opcode
}

func Run() {
  for true {
    emulateCycle()
    
    renderGraphics()
    
    handleKeyPress()
  }
}
```

For the CPU to work you'll have to implement about 35 instructions though only 34 them are needed in modern interpreters.

# What did you write the emulator in?

![Golang](https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.377846317.0222/flat,900x900,070,f.jpg)

I wrote the emulator in Go, primarily because I wanted to learn the language. I didn't use any of the concurrency related
features like channels or goroutines. Using Golang allowed me to be conscious about the size of every register that I 
created as Golang doesn't support implicit typecasting. Another feature that I loved about the language was the
out of the box support for testing.

I had a chat with a friend who pointed out some resources to improve your Golang abilities.

I haven't found time to read any of this yet, I hope to soon.

# Is the emulation perfect?

At the time of writing I figured out that there is some bug while running Invaders on the emulator as my implementation
of the instruction `0xFx0A` is buggy. I need to work on it.
