## Retrospective

1. **Running**: I wanted to run minimum 93.6 km, I am done with 160.1 km. No wins here. ✅

2. **Weight**: I weighed 59.78 this morning, which is 2.45 less than what I started but still not under 59. I have found a weakness
in Nutella Waffles. Process sugar is bad. Process sugar is addictive. In a pact with a friend to make Nutella Waffles 0 till
I actually get under 59. Other ordering is okay, as I am starting to get bored with my cooking. Anywho, lose 50 quid here.. ❌

3. **Reading**: Finished inspired but not chromosome. Still a win but no material wins here.. ✅

4. **Side Project**: I am happy with the progress I made this month. ✅

5. **Exercise**: I got 22 sessions of f45 done this month which is a lot more than 12. I get to buy another month. ✅

6. **Meditation**: This wasn't great but better than last month got 15 meditation sessions done. ✅

Here's the £50 charity.

## Month Planning

1. **Running**: 87.42 minimum, that is a daily average of 2.914. If I don't subscribe to f45 then 120 minimum. £50 penalty if I don't win.

2. **Weight**: Nutella Waffles are blocked till I am below 59. My current weight is healthy BMI but I want to get lower. If I end this month higher than
60 I get a £50 penalty.

3. **Reading**: Want to finish Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins, will get the Audio Book! £50 loss if I don't finish.

4. **Exercise**: If I do sign up for f45, I want to do 12 classes minimum! £50 loss otherwise.

In addition to the above will track progress for meditation and side projects and report back!
