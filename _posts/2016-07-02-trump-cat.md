After being inspired by Drumpfinator and being disgusted by Donald Trump, I decided to build an extension that replaces images of Donald Trump with Cats

##TrumpCat 1.0

TrumpCat 1.0 used two APIs, [PlaceKitten](https://placekitten.com) and **AlchemyVision**. Whenever a page loaded the extension would go through images on the page, the extension
attached a MutationObserver to the page to take care of new images. The problem with AlchemyVision was that it only offered 150 calls a day. So I decided to get use an in-house classifier.


##TrumpCat 1.5

The current TrumpCat uses a classifier written by my friend [**@shubh24**](https://shubh24.github.io). It works great but is a bit intense on my tiny EC2 instance so
the server at times returns a 500 response. Rest of the API is also a hack and so
can't expect anything better.
