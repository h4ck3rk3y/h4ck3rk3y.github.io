This is the end of the year. This is it. This is what we have been waiting for. This one will be a bit different, after the regular
monthly retrospective I'll look at the goals I had set out in the mother of all retrospective posts, the original one from [February](https://gyani.net/blog/february-2020/).

## Retrospective for November

1. **Running**: I wanted to run minimum 87.42, I am done with 185. No material wins. ✅

2. **Weight**: I wanted to end the month at 60, I am 62.1 this morning. Clear failure. More on this later. Will be donating £50 ❌

3. **Reading**: Wanted to finish Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins. Its done. No material wins here. ✅

4. **Exercise**: I was in Dubai for 2 weeks but I still got done wit the minimum 12, I did 13. ✅

Here's the £50 charity.

## Retrospective for the year

This is coming from the February post linked above, this was done without COVID in mind

1. **Running**: 1000km running ✅

2. **Running**: Run 2 half marathons, I am done with one I can do another one quite easily this week. Should be done!

3. **Running**: Run a full marathon, I again talked about doing this early January, might just get to it.  Lets see!

4. **Boxing**: I did go for classes regularly before the pandemic happened, now going gymming. Will cut myself some slack on this.

5. **Build A Product**: Say Hi to [Fetch](https://app.getfetch.io/)! ✅

6. **Extreme Ownership At Work**: Had no measures for this but have got good feedback so far. ✅


## Month Planning

1. **Running** I want to run 125km this month so that I can get to 1500km. That's the minimum. I define getting to 1550km as ideal and 1609km as good. Let's see! It's already
beyond the yearly goal. Looking back at the yearly goal, I want to run one more half marathon this month. £50 loss if I don't hit 125km for the month.

2. **Weight** I want to be back below 60. I definitely don't want to go up any more. 2kg a month is ambitious and realistic and should keep me occupied. £50 is the loss. If I win
I finally get that smart scale so that I can have body fat related goals later!

3. **Meditate** I barely meditated in November as I stopped tracking it. I want to do at least 15 meditations this month. No material wins here, £50 loss if I don't meditate.

4. **Reading** I want to read Genghis Khan and the Making of The Modern World this month.

Otherwise, I plan on continuing to build Fetch in my free time, maximizing home cooking while I can and travelling at the end of the year. Let's see!
