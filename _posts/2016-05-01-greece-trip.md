11 days from now I will be leaving for Greece for around 11 days. This covers the route that I will be following. Having booked all my hotels on [Agoda](https://agoda.com), I have my fingers crossed.

So the route is as follows.

From **12th of May** to the **14th of May** I will be in Kos, Greece. I haven't seen any images of Kos so I won't attach anything as the expectations picture.


From **14th of May** to the **16th of May** I will be in Rhodes, Greece.

From **16th of May** to the **18th of May** I'll be in the famous Greek Island called Santorini.

**19th of May** I'll be in Athens. **20th of May** I'll be visiting Delphi and in the evening I'll be headed to Kalabaka. On **21st of May** I'll be visiting Meteora and returning back to Athens. On **22nd of May** I fly back to
Mumbai.
