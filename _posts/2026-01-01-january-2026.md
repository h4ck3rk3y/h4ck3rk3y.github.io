I'm back.

It's been over a year since I last wrote here—a brief California post in September 2024, and before that, July 2023. The writing muscle has atrophied.

2023 and 2024 were... complicated. The blog slipped, the eating slipped. But the running? I ran my first full marathons—September 2023 and April 2024—finishing both under 3h41m. I also hit a 1h38m half. Less consistent, yes, but I was running longer than ever before (previously only halves). The monkey wasn't purely winning. Just picking its battles.

2025 was different—consumed by [tabtabtab.ai](https://tabtabtab.ai). Six days a week, thirteen hour days. Hard work, not instant gratification chasing. But the fitness still slipped. The weight crept up. The blog gathered more dust.

I want to keep working that hard on meaningful things. But being healthy is the foundation. Can't build long-term if the body falls apart.

So here I am. Writing something minimal to break the seal. Deeper posts coming soon.

## The State of Things

**Weight** is back up to 74kg. I didn't measure this morning, but I will be consistent going forward. For context, here's what happened between January 2020 and December 2020:

| Metric | Jan 2020 | Dec 2020 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Weight | 75.95 kg | 62.1 kg |
| Running | 23.8 km (Jan) | 1000+ km (year) |
| Books | Starting | Consistent |

Somehow I'm back to where I started. Six years of progress, gone. The monkey wins again if I let it.

**Running** is down. Way down. But that changes today. I'm running today.

**Reading** is actually going well. I'm a few books in and will finish a Bukowski and a Murakami this month.

## January Goals

**Running** — At least 100km this month. I will run today.

**Weight** — I want to be below 63kg eventually, ideally hitting 59kg later this year. For January, I'd be very happy to lose 2kg.

**Reading** — Finish one Bukowski and one Murakami.

## Stakes

If I run 100km this month OR lose 2kg, I'm gifting myself an Invincible Run.

If I fail both, £50 goes to charity.

That's it. Minimal. Just getting words on the page again.

More soon.
