I'm back.

It's been over a year since I last wrote here—a brief California post in September 2024, and before that, July 2023. The writing muscle has atrophied.

2023 and early 2024 were active. Not consistent, but I was doing things. The running was there, I ran my first full marathons in September 2023 and April 2024, finishing both under 3h41m. Hit a 1h38m half too. Longer distances than ever before (previously only halves). The monkey wasn't winning. Just less structured.

Then May 2024 hit and the running slipped fully. The weight started creeping up in late 2024, and 2025 made it worse—consumed by [tabtabtab.ai](https://tabtabtab.ai). Six days a week, thirteen hour days. Hard work, not instant gratification chasing. But the fitness paid the price. The blog gathered more dust.

I want to keep working that hard on meaningful things. But being healthy is the foundation. Can't build long-term if the body falls apart. Even with 6x13h days I should find time for fitness.

So here I am. Writing something minimal to break the seal. Deeper posts coming soon.

## The State of Things

**Weight** is back up to 74kg. I didn't measure this morning, but I will be consistent going forward. For context, here's what happened between January 2020 and December 2020:

| Metric | Jan 2020 | Dec 2020 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Weight | 75.95 kg | 62.1 kg |
| Running | 23.8 km (Jan) | 1000+ km (year) |
| Books | Starting | Consistent |

Somehow I'm back to where I started. Six years of progress, gone. The monkey wins again if I let it.

**Running** is down. Way down. But that changes today. I'm running today.

**Reading** is actually going well. I'm a few books in and will finish a Bukowski and a Murakami this month.

## January Goals

**Running** — At least 100km this month. I will run today.

**Weight** — I want to be below 63kg eventually, ideally hitting 59kg later this year. For January, I'd be very happy to lose 2kg.

**Reading** — Finish one Bukowski and one Murakami.

## Stakes

If I run 100km this month OR lose 2kg, I'm gifting myself an Invincible Run.

If I fail both, £50 goes to charity.

That's it. Minimal. Just getting words on the page again.

More soon.

Update : It's the 2nd of January. I did weigth myself this morning. It's 73.70. So the goal is to be under 72 by the end of the month. That's a good goal to start with, and I did run 5 kilometers yesterday
