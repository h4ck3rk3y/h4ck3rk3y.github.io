I have been wanting to visit **Nepal** for a while now. The fascination with Nepal probably started some time in March, when I started reading about Everest Base Camp Trek. The original plan was to get fit in the next five months and to do the Trek post placement. I didn't run enough so I'll probably not go to the **Everest Base Camp**.

Earlier today I saw an [r/travel](https://reddit.com/r/travel) post by a photographer urging people to visit Nepal. I might use some of his pictures in this blog post, all credits go to him.

Now the plan is to go Kathmandu and figure out where to go from there. @[Shubhankar](https://shubh24.github.io) and @[Prabhjyot](https://psdh.github.io)
plan to join me for the trip, if anyone backs out then I go alone. I think I secretly want to go alone, I don't know I am confused.
