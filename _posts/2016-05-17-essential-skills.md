Today while taking a 6 hour cruise around the Caldera in Santorini I realized a few things.

# Need to Get Fit

While hiking to the top of *Nea Kameni* at times my back would hurt. Earlier this year we were planning to hike *Everest Base Camp*. After this mini hike I realized I am probably not fit enough to hike EBC and my back shouldn't hurt during a mini hike like this given the fact that I am just 20.

# Need to Learn How To Swim

From *Nea Kameni* we headed to the hot springs, *Palea Kameni*. To get to the springs one had to swim in the sea for less than 50 meters. The was 11 meter deep at the deepest point. I didn't trust my swimming skills enough to swim in the sea and was left seeing others swim to the spring. Swimming is an essential skill.

# Need to Learn how to ride a two wheeler

While thinking about essential skills I realized that I need to learn how to ride a bike. I was thinking of the Thousand Dollar Challenge and how I never rode the bike, sitting in the back seat the whole time. At 20 I should know how to ride a bike.

Summer looks like a good time to learn some of these things. Can learn how to ride a two wheeler courtsey Edwin during a few weekends at Pune. If my company keeps me in Courtyard by Marriot for 2 months then I can learn to swim and get fit in the process.
