It's been seven days since the last post and I have travelled about 7000 Kilometers. Haven't achieved much.

Flew into Delhi from Guwahati. Spent a few days at New Delhi meeting friends from University and School.

Then flew to London on Jet Airways. The person handling the boarding passes won't accept a 1.5 Kilo Skateboard in adition to the two bags that are allowed.

When I arrived in London, I had to wait about 2 hours to get through immigraiton. Then a long cab ride from the city to where I am staying.

Decided to cook yesterday. That required a lot more effor than I was ready for.

It has been tiring. Hope the coming weeks are better.
