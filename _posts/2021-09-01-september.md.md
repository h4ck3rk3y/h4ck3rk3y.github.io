Ok, September is here. 4 more months left. I know I am writing this on the 5th of the month. The last few days have been busy!

## Retrospective

1. **Running**: I wanted to run 180k, I ran  182k. ✅

2. **Reading**: I wanted to read "Red Mars", I ended up reading "Attack of the Blockchain" ✅

3. **Weight:**: I wanted to weigh 63. I weigh 65.5. Clearly not a win. ❌

I made a 50GBP donation to the University of Toronto for missing the weight goal.


## September

1. **Running**: I want to be at 1496km by the end of the month. That is at least 140 more kilometers in the next 25 days. So about 5.6 a day. Lets round this up to
6 a day, for a total of 150 in the next 25 days as the ideal goal.

2. **Reading**: I want to finish "Subtle art of not giving a fck" by Mark Manson.

3. **Weight**: I weighed 65.90 this morning. Not proud. 3 days of eating and no exercise. 63 would be ideal.
