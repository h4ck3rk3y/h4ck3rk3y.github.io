Recently I had the idea of analyzing the Internet to find *Goodwin's Number*. I call the comment which has comparisons with Nazis and Hitler *Goodwin's Comment* and the average position at which *Goodwin's Comment* occurs for a forum the *Goodwin's Number*.

I plan on analyzing various websites starting with Reddit looking for the *Goodwin's Number* of particular subreddits and of Reddit as a whole. First I need some Food and Soda. I'll head to the All Night Canteen for some chicken pasta, work starts as soon as I come back.

I'll be updating this blog post as the research progresses.
