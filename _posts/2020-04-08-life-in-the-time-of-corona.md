## early month reality check

In the last two months around the 17th or the 20th I'd post early wins where the minimum number of kilometers was hit. This months it's going to be the opposite. I've just run 17.27 km. That sucks. That's an average of 2.15875 km. I've been blaming this on the virus. I can't be outside of the home at all after 8 pm till 6 am. I can't be away from my building and the nearest running track is closed. I've also started snacking outside of IF hours. So that isn't holding either. The combination of work out and IF worked well. Now both of them have been crashing. I don't have a proper schedule any more. I'm busy with work and then the I barely have any time before the 8 pm curfew.  Should I start waking up early? That's tough.

I'm taking out time to reflect on the last 8 days in order to decide what can be done.

## April Revisited

Corona has been winning. I'm tuning these rules, adding more prizes but not subtracting punishments.

1. **Running** Want to do a minimum of 87.42 km. Have done 17.27 km so far. Quick math suggests I have 70.15 left over 22 days. It's also getting hotter now. I have lost the flexibility to do night runs / morning runs. Either I have to wake up really early or fix time in the evening. I was being ambitious and wanted to do 160 km but I don't think that's happening. To encourage my self I'm lowering the daily minimum and the weekend premium. Now I'll run a daily minimum of 3.2 km(70.15). I'll have more time on Friday & Saturday and to build some buffer I should run 6 km on those days. Let's see. Hoping that the task doesn't seem daunting and I just run. Pace is forgiven, go and get that podcast run. Punishment: Donate GBP 50 to diabetes charity or food bank. Win: I get twins heavy jumping ropes.

2. **Weight** 2. **Weight** I aimed at being 66.5. I started at 69.25. I have seen lows of 68.5. That's still two far from the goal! Measured at 69.05 this morning. Note to self only eat between 1pm and 9pm. No matter what day of the weak. Note to self don't buy dorritos in
the shopping center. Note to self, stick to 1500 calories. Still a little hopeful here, as said will stick to IF(1pm to 9 pm) and 1500, will start logging IF times as a forcing function. Loss: Donation of GBP 50. Win: Weighing machine.

3. **Reading** Minimum: Finish death end & 5 more intelligent investor chapters. I think deaths end will be done. I'm not so sure about intelligent investor. I started watching Aswath Damodarns investment philosophies course. Any who, Loss: Education Charity and Win: A lamp!

4. **Side Project** Wanted to ship a defined project. Currently the project is basic CI. Haven't made much progress here. Maybe over the weekend? Loss: 50GBP to Wikipedia and loss of Netflix. Win: Hitman 2.
