## Problem

During my days in Pilani(sob), I had a Logitech speaker. I would play a lot of music on it. The songs were mostly played from YouTube. I would open a lot of songs in different tabs and just visit one tab to start playing a song. After the song had ended it had to be closed and a new tab had to be selected. Tiring right?

## Solution

Last night I hacked together a chrome extension that would close the tab which had just finished playing and start playing a song on a random tab containing a not yet started YouTube video.

Hence the name Shuffle and Kill. You can get the chrome extension  ![here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lpmlbpbaopjjlfilhkpbbkbnlngmdogj/)
