So I was in Kos Island, Greece for the last few days. It was fun. The city was more fun than expected. The organizers of European Federation of Immunogenetics chose Kos as Kos is where Hippocrates was born. Greece looks normal and feels normal, something different from what one gets by reading newspapers.

We visited a couple of places. Tried Gyros, have been having Chicken Gyros for the last 4 meals. Now we'll move on to Mousaka or something else. We visited a few places like the Castle of Knights, Hippocrates Tree, Ancient Agora and Askelpios. Overall it was a nice quite island, the sea was amazing.

Now we are at Rhodes, we visited Lindos today. More about the two cities along with images later.
