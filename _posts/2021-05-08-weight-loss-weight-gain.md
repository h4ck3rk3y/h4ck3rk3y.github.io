I have to write this blog post. I have strayed off the path. I want to get back on the path
by the time I am done writing this post and create some accountability.


### The Problem

If you have been following this blog in the last year you must have seen monthly
pots about weight, running and reading. Last year I lost a lot of weight, when I started I was 75.95 kilos and at my lowest I was 59.33 kilos. The lowest weight
was on the 24th of October. The last measurement for 2020, was on the 10th of December, the day I flew to America for a trip. I was 60.73 kilos on that day. I was back home to Abu Dhabi
on the 14th of January and I measured 62.95 kilos on that day, thats about 2 kilos gained while in America.


This morning I weighed in at 64.90 kilos. The lowest I have weighed this year has been 61.75 and the highest I have weighed has been 65.65. I am slowly but steadily erasing
the progress that I made last year. Here are a couple of graphs that illustrate the problem.

This graph is from last year! See how consistently I have been weighing myself being mindful about my weight.

This graph is from this year. It continuously breaks. The measurement starts on the 1st of February because
I had data for January in a different chart. Weights going up.


### What has changed?

I have been running more than I did last year. Last year I set out to run 1000k and ended up running around 1550k. This year I have set a goal
of 2000k and I am tracking well. For most of the year that was my exercise. In February & March I was boxing and in October and November
I was going to F45 but for the bulk of the year I was going for a run. Which I am still doing.

My eating habit has changed. When I was traveling in America I stopped intermittent fasting and stopped counting calories as well. I came back
and spent around 12 days in a hotel in Dubai. While I was at the Hotel I was still ordering from outside and that slowly became a habit.

Ordering food online is really easy. Extremely easy. I order food and then I end up ordering desert. I order when I am not hungry.
I order when I am bored. I do "emotional eating". I have not been able to  enforce the sugar bans, the food ordering bans or
intermittent fasting.


### What do I do?

I need to get back on track. I need to stop straying from the way. I'll be religious about logging my weight in the morning. I'll be
religious about intermittent fasting. I'll not eat if I am not hungry. If this month turns out bad, I'll start counting calories
religiously again.

Holding the eating binge, being disciplined feels good. Gratifying myself with food feels good for a few minutes and mid-way during
the eating it feels like crap. I should focus on being more disciplined, and the reward that comes from holding the line.
