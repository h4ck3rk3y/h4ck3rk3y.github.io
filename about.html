I love programming in <strong>python and lua</strong>. Check out <a href="/projects">my projects</a>. I also have deep interest in security which I have tried to follow through courses, moocs, books, internships and research. Recently I have been using a lot of C++ as that's the weapon of choice at Bloomberg.
